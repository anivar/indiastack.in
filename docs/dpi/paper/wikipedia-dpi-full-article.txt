Examples of DPI include India's [[Aadhaar|Aadhaar system]] for digital identity, UPI for payments, and the [[India Stack]] data exchange framework.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-02-24 |title=Scale of digital public infrastructure staggering: UIDAI CEO Saurabh Garg |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/scale-of-digital-public-infrastructure-staggering-uidai-ceo-saurabh-garg/articleshow/98207044.cms?from=mdr |access-date=2025-02-22 |work=The Economic Times |issn=0013-0389}}</ref> However, these systems have also faced criticism regarding privacy, mandatory participation requirements, and exclusion of vulnerable populations from welfare benefits due to authentication failures.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Aadhaar |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aadhaar |website=Wikipedia}}</ref> Another example of digital public infrastructures is Estonia's [[X-Road]], which is an open-source government data exchange system.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Krewer |first=Jan |date=March 13, 2024 |title=Signs of progress: Digital Public Infrastructure is gaining traction |url=https://openfuture.eu/blog/signs-of-progress-digital-public-infrastructure-is-gaining-traction/ |access-date=2025-02-22 |website=[[Open Future]] CCBY |language=en-US}}</ref> Initiatives such as the German Sovereign Tech Fund provides funding for open digital infrastructure.<ref name=":0" />

DPI plays a role in modernizing public services by supporting initiatives in areas like [[e-governance]], [[Medical record|health records]] management, and [[Digital Education|education]]. By ensuring the availability and operation of [[Data infrastructure|digital infrastructures]], it can affect the efficiency of [[public service]] delivery and influence trust in digital systems.<ref>{{Cite web |title=What is digital public infrastructure? |url=https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/digital-public-infrastructure |access-date=2025-02-22 |website=[[Gates Foundation]] |language=en}}</ref> The implementation of DPI involves addressing issues related to [[privacy]], [[data security]], and equitable access. Critics argue that these concerns are often treated as implementation details rather than structural preconditions, with systems deployed before accountability mechanisms are established.<ref name=":0" /> The mandatory nature of some DPI systems has raised questions about whether they represent public goods or instruments of administrative control. DPI also implies governments taking more responsibility in the maintenance of the underlying technological stack for the digital public sphere to build a shared public infrastructure that prioritizes public values, democracy, and accessibility.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news |title=How digital public infrastructure supports empowerment, inclusion, and resilience |url=https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/digital-development/how-digital-public-infrastructure-supports-empowerment-inclusion-and-resilience |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20241210014040/https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/digital-development/how-digital-public-infrastructure-supports-empowerment-inclusion-and-resilience |archive-date=2024-12-10 |access-date=2025-02-22 |work=World Bank Blogs |language=en}}</ref>

In the 2020s, discussion about digital public infrastructure has increased in prominence, with actors from both the public and private sectors endorsing its applications.<ref name=":0" />

==History==
The concept of treating digital systems as public infrastructure has evolved over decades. Early examples of DPI date back to foundational technologies like the [[Internet]] and [[GPS]], which were publicly funded and made universally available.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Kilroy |first1=Annie |last2=Migwe-Kagume |first2=Charlene |date=2024-09-17 |title=Mythbusters: Digital Public Infrastructure & Digital Public Goods |url=https://developmentgateway.org/blog/mythbusters-digital-public-infrastructure-digital-public-goods/ |access-date=2025-06-16 |website=Development Gateway}}</ref> However, until recently, such systems were often siloed and not thought of as one cohesive public infrastructure.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last1=Bandura |first1=Romina |last2=McLean |first2=Madeleine |last3=Sultan |first3=Sarosh |date=2023-12-20 |title=Unpacking the Concept of Digital Public Infrastructure and Its Importance for Global Development |url=https://www.csis.org/analysis/unpacking-concept-digital-public-infrastructure-and-its-importance-global-development |website=Center for Strategic & International Studies |language=en}}</ref>

The term "digital public infrastructure" itself gained prominence in the early 2020s, especially as countries started building integrated digital service platforms. India provided an early model for the concept: its government launched the [[Aadhaar]] digital ID system in 2010 (now the world's largest biometric ID database) and opened it up for use in both public and private services. This was followed by open digital payment platforms and data-sharing frameworks, collectively known as the [[India Stack]]. These were conceptualized as "government-owned, non-competing" digital utilities on which others could build services. Other nations had parallel developments: Estonia built its [[X-Road]] data exchange system in the 2000s, enabling government and private databases to talk to each other securely<ref name=":0"></ref> and laying the groundwork for the later development of Estonia's [[e-government]] services.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-03-07 |title=Why digital sovereignty matters and how X-Road makes it happen |url=https://nortal.com/insights/why-digital-sovereignty-matters-and-how-x-road-makes-it-happen |access-date=2025-06-16 |website=nortal.com |language=en}}</ref>

By the 2020s, thinkers and policymakers began explicitly using the infrastructure analogy, framing online services as critical infrastructure that should be broadly accessible, akin to public roads.<ref name=":0"></ref> In 2023, global consensus on a definition of DPI emerged. G20 leaders in 2023 welcomed a framework for systems of digital public infrastructure, describing DPI as shared, interoperable digital systems for service delivery at societal scale.[https://g20.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/G20-2023_India_Declaracao-de-Lideres.pdf] During [[2023 G20 New Delhi summit|India's G20 presidency]], world leaders agreed to describe digital public infrastructure as "a set of shared digital systems that are secure and interoperable, built on open standards, to deliver equitable access to public and/or private services at societal scale."<ref>{{Cite web |date=February 13, 2024 |title=What we can expect for digital public infrastructure in 2024 |url=https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/02/dpi-digital-public-infrastructure/ |website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> That same year, the United Nations also identified DPI as a high-impact initiative for achieving the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], with over 100 countries committing support.<ref name=":1" />

==Criticism and concerns==

===Definitional ambiguity===
Critics have noted that the term "digital public infrastructure" conflates two distinct meanings of "public": population-scale deployment versus public accountability and governance.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rajendra-Nicolucci |first=Mila Samdub, Chand |date=2024-11-25 |title=What is Digital Public Infrastructure? Towards More Specificity |url=https://techpolicy.press/what-is-digital-public-infrastructure-towards-more-specificity |website=Tech Policy Press}}</ref> A system may serve an entire population while remaining structurally unaccountable to those it affects. The G20 definition uses aspirational language ("should be," "can be") rather than verifiable structural conditions, leading scholars to argue that current definitions exclude nothing and therefore define nothing.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eaves|first1=David|last2=Rao|first2=Krisstina|year=2025|title=Digital Public Infrastructure: a framework for conceptualisation and measurement|journal=UCL Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose Working Paper Series|volume=IIPP WP 2025-01|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/sites/bartlett/files/dpi_conceptualisation_and_measurement.pdf}}</ref>

===Privacy and surveillance===
Digital public infrastructure systems have raised significant [[privacy]] concerns. Large-scale identity systems collect [[biometrics|biometric data]] and transaction records that enable comprehensive surveillance of populations. Critics drawing on [[Shoshana Zuboff]]'s analysis of [[surveillance capitalism]] argue that DPI systems, even when government-operated, can enable the commodification of personal data and behavioral prediction at population scale.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Zuboff |first=Shoshana |title=The Age of Surveillance Capitalism |publisher=PublicAffairs |year=2019 |isbn=978-1610395694}}</ref>

The mandatory nature of some DPI systems, where refusal results in exclusion from essential services, raises questions about whether consent can be freely given when the alternative is denial of food rations, banking, or healthcare.

===Exclusion and the digital divide===
DPI implementations have documented patterns of excluding vulnerable populations. In India, biometric authentication failures in the [[Aadhaar]] system have led to denial of food rations and welfare benefits, with reports linking such failures to deaths from starvation.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dreze |first=Jean |date=2018 |title=Starvation Deaths and Aadhaar |work=The Wire |url=https://thewire.in/rights/jharkhand-starvation-deaths-aadhaar}}</ref> The [[digital divide]] means that populations without reliable internet access, digital literacy, or stable biometrics (manual laborers, elderly people) face systematic exclusion from systems designed to serve them.

The assumption that digital systems improve efficiency can mask the creation of new barriers. Binary authentication (success or failure) replaces human discretion that previously allowed for edge cases and exceptions.

===Commons governance===
Scholars applying [[Elinor Ostrom]]'s framework for [[common-pool resource]] governance have argued that most DPI systems fail the conditions required for legitimate commons management.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ostrom |first=Elinor |title=Governing the Commons |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1990}}</ref> Ostrom's design principles require that those affected by rules participate in making them, that monitoring be accountable to users, and that dispute resolution be accessible and low-cost. Critics observe that DPI systems typically invert these conditions: citizens are fully visible to the system while the system remains opaque to citizens; rules are set through executive or technocratic processes without meaningful public participation; and redress requires litigation rather than accessible local resolution.

===Structural accountability===
Some researchers distinguish between systems that are merely population-scale and those that are structurally accountable to affected populations. This perspective argues that genuine public infrastructure requires: the ability to refuse participation without penalty; transparent and inspectable execution; independent verification of system behavior; binding governance input from those affected; and the feasibility of alternative implementations.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Aravind |first=Anivar A |title=Corrigibility as a Structural Precondition for Digital Public Infrastructure: A Cybernetic Framework |url=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18213695 |website=Zenodo |date=2026}}</ref> By these criteria, systems such as the [[Linux kernel]], [[Let's Encrypt]], and [[Wikipedia]] meet structural requirements for public infrastructure, while some systems promoted as DPI do not.
