        <li><strong>Lifelong Profiles:</strong> Data from age 6 follows you forever. A registry that never forgets, never forgives, never deletes.</li>
        <li><strong>No Exit:</strong> Once enrolled, you cannot leave. No delete button. No opt-out. The system remembers.</li>

      <h2>What Parents Can Do</h2>
      <p>SFLC.in provides a template letter for parents who wish to opt out of APAAR enrollment. However, even this option is being undermined as states make enrollment practically mandatory.</p>
      
      <p>The fundamental issue: parents should not need to actively resist a system that lacks legal backing and violates data protection principles. The burden is wrongly placed on citizens to protect themselves from their own government's data collection.</p>
