        <h4>PRware: The Brand Without a Codebase</h4>
        <p><strong>"India Stack" is PRware</strong>, a marketing term by iSPIRT that brands separate closed systems as unified "open" infrastructure. There is no entity called "India Stack." Aadhaar is owned by UIDAI. UPI by NPCI. ABDM by NHA. DigiLocker by MeitY. All closed source. All separately governed.</p>
        <p class="mt-1">The branding came first. The code exists in silos. Private entities build it. Government adopts, endorses, and mandates it. By the time Parliament debates, the infrastructure is already deployed. The architecture is already the policy.</p>

        <h3>Reversibility Decreases at Each Stage</h3>

        <ul class="issues-list">
          <li><strong>At Stage 1 (Code):</strong> Could have been designed differently. Open source or closed. Centralized or federated. With consent or without. All choices still open.</li>
          <li><strong>At Stage 2 (Deployment):</strong> Early adopters invested. Changing architecture means rebuilding. But still possible.</li>
          <li><strong>At Stage 3 (Adoption):</strong> Ecosystem dependent. Banks, apps, government services integrated. Switching costs high. Network effects lock in.</li>
          <li><strong>At Stage 4 (Endorsement):</strong> Political capital invested. Criticism becomes politically costly. Alternatives seen as "anti-progress."</li>
          <li><strong>At Stage 5 (Law):</strong> Legal framework built around existing architecture. Changing requires new legislation. System is now "constitutional."</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="concern">
          Democratic input arrives when changing course is most difficult. The window for genuine choice closes before the debate begins.

Builds the code           Adopts it              Private code, public mandate

Profits from ecosystem        Provides legitimacy         Risk socialized, profit privatized

THIS IS NOT:
• Public sector building public infrastructure
• Private sector competing in open market
• Public-private partnership with accountability

THIS IS:
• Private infrastructure blessed by state
• Monopoly created through adoption mandate
• "Public" in name, private in control

                   → Citizen has no recourse

Payment system goes down       Not the protocol designers, "open standards"
→ transactions fail         Not the apps, "following specifications"
                   Not the government, "private sector operates it"
                   → Merchant has no recourse

Health data exposed         Not the ministry, "technical implementation"
→ privacy violated          Not the platform, "following guidelines"

No one bears the accountability.
