    </div>

    <div class="info-box">
      <h3>Biometric Exclusion</h3>
      <p>Fingerprints wear away from manual labor. Construction workers, farmers, domestic workers face <span class="highlight">6-12% authentication failure rates</span>.</p>
      <p>Elderly people have degraded fingerprints. Children's biometrics are unstable. People with disabilities face accessibility barriers.</p>
      <p>In 2023, UIDAI acknowledged <span class="highlight">54+ hours of service downtime</span> due to OTP delays and server issues.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-label">2023-25: Facial Authentication Expansion</div>
    <div class="info-box">
      <h3>Despite Known Failures, Biometrics Expand</h3>
      <p>After years of documented fingerprint exclusion, states are now adding facial authentication. Rajasthan mandated it for pensioners via RAJSSP app (February 2023). Results from January-April 2025:</p>
      <p><span class="highlight">Facial authentication success: 69.11%</span>, nearly 1 in 3 pensioners fail.</p>
      <p>Fingerprint authentication: 76.27% success. OTP had 90%+ success but government deemed it "unreliable."</p>
      <p>The system was tested on only <span class="highlight">15-20 people</span> before statewide rollout to 600,000+ pensioners in Jaipur alone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="info-box danger">
      <h3>Consent Is Structurally Broken</h3>
      <p>UIDAI claims authentication requires "explicit consent." But <span class="highlight">consent is meaningless when refusal means exclusion</span>.</p>
      <p>This pattern repeats across India Stack:</p>
      <ul class="list-arrow">
        <li><strong>Aadhaar:</strong> No ration card without it. No pension. No bank account.</li>
        <li><strong>UPI:</strong> Bank account required. KYC mandatory. Phone number linked.</li>
        <li><strong>ABDM:</strong> Health ID pushed at hospitals. Opt-out unclear.</li>
        <li><strong>FASTag:</strong> Mandatory by law. No alternative.</li>
        <li><strong>CoWIN:</strong> No vaccine without registration. Digital-only access.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When the cost of refusal is starvation, medical exclusion, or losing your pension, <span class="highlight">that's not consent. That's coercion.</span></p>
    </div>

      <p>CoWIN required smartphone, internet, and digital literacy. <span class="highlight">200-280 million Indians (33-45% of 18-44 age group)</span> had no or poor internet access.</p>

      <h3>Key Findings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Documented (2019):</strong> Of 42 hunger-related deaths since 2017, 25 were linked to Aadhaar issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Washington Post (2018):</strong> "India's biometric ID program was supposed to end welfare corruption. But the neediest may be hit hardest." Authentication failures prevented thousands from receiving entitlements.</li>
        <li><strong>JPAL Study (2020):</strong> 88% of 1.44 lakh cancelled ration cards in Jharkhand belonged to genuine beneficiaries, not "ghosts."</li>
        <li><strong>IIT Delhi (Reetika Khera):</strong> Continued quantity fraud, higher transaction costs, and exclusion of the most vulnerable since Aadhaar-Based Biometric Authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Food Campaign:</strong> 57 starvation deaths documented in nine Indian states from 2015 onwards. At least 19 directly linked to Aadhaar.</li>
        <li><strong>CAG Report (2022):</strong> UIDAI takes no responsibility for deficient biometric capture. Onus passed to Aadhaar holders.</li>
        <li><strong>SFLC.in (2021):</strong> CoWIN created digital exclusion, mandatory for 18-44 age group, disadvantaging those without smartphones or internet.</li>

    <div class="info-box">
      <h3>Orissa High Court (May 2023)</h3>
      <p>"Welfare schemes are meant to cater to the needs of the most vulnerable and poor sections of our society who <span class="highlight">cannot be excluded on any ground, including the lack of an Aadhaar Card or a mobile phone</span>."</p>
      <p>The court noted that Subhalaxmi Tarai, suffering from cerebral palsy and secondary malnutrition, had died.</p>

    <div class="info-box">
      <h3>Supreme Court (March 2021)</h3>
      <p>Agreed to hear petition challenging deletion of 3 crore ration cards. The petition (Koili Devi v. Union of India) was filed by Santoshi Kumari's mother.</p>
      <p>Starvation deaths documented across: Jharkhand, UP, Odisha, Karnataka, MP, Maharashtra, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana.</p>

      <h3>Section 57 Restored (TechCrunch, 2025)</h3>
      <p>In 2018, Supreme Court struck down Section 57 that allowed private entities to use Aadhaar. The government has now <span class="highlight">effectively re-legislated</span> this through amendments.</p>
      <p>Private companies in e-commerce, hospitality, healthcare can now access Aadhaar authentication. No guardrails defined to prevent misuse of biometric IDs.</p>

      <h3>e-KYC Drive (2024)</h3>
      <p>June 2024: Government directed 100% e-KYC compliance for all ration card holders.</p>
      <p>Odisha "temporarily suspended" rice distribution for <span class="highlight">20+ lakh eligible individuals</span> for e-KYC non-compliance.</p>

      <h3>When Systems Fail, Humans Pay</h3>
      <p>Every system has errors. The question is: who bears the cost?</p>
      <p>In India Stack, the system never fails. It only denies. When your biometrics don't match, when seeding is wrong, when the network is down, <strong>you</strong> failed. Not the system. You must prove it wrong. You cannot opt out. You cannot see why you were denied. You cannot fix it yourself. You can only wait, appeal, and hope.</p>
      <p class="mt-1">With 6-12% biometric failure rates, millions are denied. The system records no error. For some, that denial is fatal.</p>
