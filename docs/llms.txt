# India Stack Watch

> Critical analysis of Digital Public Infrastructure through cybernetics, commons governance, and free software principles.

## Core Thesis

A digital system is legitimate only if it is **structurally corrigible** by those it affects.

**Corrigibility**: The structural capacity of affected populations to detect error, apply pressure, and trigger correction—without suffering material harm.

This is not ethics. It is cybernetics. When correction is structurally unavailable, error accumulates until the system fails catastrophically or requires authoritarian enforcement.

## DPI Corrigibility Framework

Universal framework for evaluating Digital Public Infrastructure. Five structural tests. One question: **Can those affected correct the system?**

Released under **CC0 1.0 Universal** (Public Domain). Use freely.

### Framework Structure

| Page | URL | Purpose |
|------|-----|---------|
| Main Framework | /dpi/ | Five tests, G20/UN critique, India Stack scorecard |
| Why Corrigibility | /dpi/analysis/ | Control theory proof, Ashby's Law, legitimacy debt |
| How to Build | /dpi/build/ | Six mandatory architectural primitives |
| How to Require | /dpi/require/ | Legal and procurement instruments |
| Definitions | /dpi/definitions/ | G20, UNDP, World Bank analysis |
| Learned Systems | /dpi/learned-systems/ | AI and stochastic system governance (Annex) |
| Terminology | /terminology/ | Operational definitions |
| Methods | /methods/ | Evaluation procedure |

### The Five Tests

| Test | Code | Question | Failure Mode |
|------|------|----------|--------------|
| EXIT | Safe Refusal | Can people refuse the system without penalty? | Coercion without escape |
| CODE | Legible Execution | Are executable rules publicly inspectable? | Unverifiable power |
| AUDIT | Independent Verifiability | Can claims be tested without permission? | Unfalsifiable authority |
| GOVERN | Constitutive Input | Do affected populations have rule-making input? | Imposed governance |
| FORK | Credible Replacement | Is replacement technically and legally possible? | Monopoly entrenchment |

**Failure of any single test is fatal.** Binary tests, not a scoring rubric.

### Learned Systems Extension

For AI and learned systems, the five tests apply with extended verification:

| Test | Deterministic Verification | Learned System Verification |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| EXIT | Can refuse the system | Disclosure + non-AI alternative |
| CODE | Source code | Training pipeline transparency |
| AUDIT | Inspect logic | Statistical bounds + monitoring |
| GOVERN | Maintainer process | Objective governance |
| FORK | Copy and deploy | Resource forkability (compute + data) |

**Training data is an upstream commons.** When enclosed without governance, learned systems inherit legitimacy without constraints.

### Six Build Primitives

1. **Reproducible Execution** — Binary reproducible from source
2. **Modular Architecture** — Components independently replaceable
3. **Fork-Authorizing Licenses** — AGPL or equivalent
4. **Audit Surfaces** — External verification without permission
5. **Safe Refusal Paths** — Non-digital alternatives, no penalty
6. **Policy-as-Code Governance** — Versioned, auditable, forkable rules

## Three Analytical Lenses

Three independent traditions converge on the same structural requirements:

### 1. Cybernetics (Control Theory)
- **Question**: Can those affected observe and trigger correction?
- **Failure**: Runaway—error amplifies to collapse or lock-in
- **Reference**: Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety

### 2. Commons Governance (Ostrom)
- **Question**: Who governs the shared resource? Who decides rules?
- **Failure**: Enclosure—public goods become club goods
- **Reference**: Eight Principles for Managing Commons

### 3. FOSS Principles
- **Question**: Can power be observed, verified, and replaced?
- **Failure**: Lock-in—users trapped in systems they cannot exit
- **Reference**: Four Software Freedoms

## India Stack Assessment

| Test | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| EXIT | FAIL | No Aadhaar deletion. Welfare conditioned on enrollment. |
| CODE | FAIL | Zero lines of core Aadhaar/UPI source code published. |
| AUDIT | FAIL | UIDAI RTI-exempt. No independent security audits. |
| GOVERN | FAIL | No public comment. Private foundations control. |
| FORK | FAIL | Closed source. Centralized. Replication prohibited. |

### Documented Harms

- **~100 starvation deaths** linked to Aadhaar authentication failures
- **4.39 crore ration cards deleted** (88% genuine beneficiaries)
- **1.1 billion records** exposed (WEF: "largest data breach in history")
- **31-49% biometric failure rates** in field conditions

### Test Analysis Pages
- /exit/ — EXIT: Safe Refusal
- /foss/ — CODE: Legible Execution
- /audit/ — AUDIT: Independent Verifiability
- /participate/ — GOVERN: Constitutive Input
- /fork/ — FORK: Credible Replacement

### Component Deep Dives

- /payments/ — DBT, PFMS, financial flows
- /health/ — ABDM, CoWIN, consent violations
- /education/ — APAAR, DIKSHA, children's data
- /data/ — Account Aggregator, Digi Yatra
- /governance/ — Code first, policy later
- /ai/ — Next layer, same pattern

### Evidence

## Key Concepts

### Bearer Credentials vs Identification Systems

| Property | Bearer Credentials | Identification Systems |
|----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Examples | Passport, cash | Biometric databases |
| Principle | Possession = authorization | System verifies, system decides |
| Verification | Once, at issuance | Every transaction |
| Power | Person → Institution | Institution → Person |

### Open-Washing Patterns

| Pattern | Claim | Reality |
|---------|-------|---------|
| API-as-Openness | "Open APIs" | How to call, not how it works |
| Spec-as-Source | "Open specs" | Protocols, not implementations |
| Funnel Open-Sourcing | "It's on GitHub" | Clients open, backends closed |
| DID-Washing | "W3C compliant" | Decentralized vocabulary, centralized trust |
| Safety-Washing | "Safety team" | Policy without audit |
